# Multi-Class-Text-Classification-BERT

## Data Description
For our case study, we will be using the datasets from the hugging face library.
The BERT model will be built on the AG News dataset.

- AG News (AG’s News Corpus) is a sub dataset of AG's corpus of news articles
constructed by assembling titles and description fields of articles from the 4
largest classes
- The four classes are: World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech
- The AG News contains 30,000 training and 1,900 test samples per class.

## Aim

The project aims at building, training and fine tuning the BERT model with respect to
classification on the AG News dataset.


## Tech stack

- Language - Python
- Libraries – ktrain, transformers, datasets, numpy, pandas, tensorflow, timeit
